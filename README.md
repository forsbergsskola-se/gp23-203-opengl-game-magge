## Project description
Our assignment was to create a simple game using SDL and further develop our skills in C++, Object Oriented Programming and using Design Patterns over a period of 1 - 2 weeks. We chose to re-make the classic arcade game **Space Invaders**, keeping the original look and mechanics, but adding our own twist to it. 


## Troubles we encountered
* Weird player and monster movement (Solved by capping frame rate using a timer).
* Circular dependencies (Solved by forward declarations and file management).
* Include-explosions (Move definitions to .cpp file)


## One Class we’re particularly happy about
Pick one.. 
```
//here is our amazing class
```


## Design Patterns we used
*  **Object Pooling** (used for enemies, projectiles and bombs)
*  **Update Method** (for rendering all active game objects in sceene)


## STD Classes we used
*  Using std::vector for all pools mentioned above. 
*  std::string to load paths for .png textures and store in an array to randomise monster texture.


## Conclusion
 Bla bla bla.. Happy happy bla.
